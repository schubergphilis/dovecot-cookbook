  # Workarounds for various client bugs:
  #   delay-newmail:
  #     Send EXISTS/RECENT new mail notifications only when replying to NOOP
  #     and CHECK commands. Some clients ignore them otherwise, for example OSX
  #     Mail (<v2.1). Outlook Express breaks more badly though, without this it
  #     may show user "Message no longer in server" errors. Note that OE6 still
  #     breaks even with this workaround if synchronization is set to
  #     "Headers Only".
  #   tb-extra-mailbox-sep:
  #     With mbox storage a mailbox can contain either mails or submailboxes,
  #     but not both. Thunderbird separates these two by forcing server to
  #     accept '/' suffix in mailbox names in subscriptions list.
  #   tb-lsub-flags:
  #     Show \Noselect flags for LSUB replies with LAYOUT=fs (e.g. mbox).
  #     This makes Thunderbird realize they aren't selectable and show them
  #     greyed out, instead of only later giving "not selectable" popup error.
